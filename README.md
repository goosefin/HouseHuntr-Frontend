# HouseHuntr

Finding housing is always difficult and there are many applications in the market that potential renters use to find their next home. However, there isn’t a single application out there which allows users to keep track of the apartments/houses they like in a single location. That’s where HouseHuntr comes in! This app allows users to organize their search into four major categories: Wishlist, Scheduled, Seen and Applied. Users are prompted to manually enter the information on each apartment being added to their wishlist and update the data as they move through the process of picking a home. Users can also enter a link to take them directly to all listings.
